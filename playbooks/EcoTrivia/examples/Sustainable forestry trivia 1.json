As a result, various attempts have been made to\ndevelop international and national standards of sustainable forest management.

This is development which is economically viable, environmentally benign and socially\nbeneficial, and which balances present and future needs (see Box 1.1).\nInteractions between the flora and fauna in a forest ecosystem are complex and often poorly\nunderstood.

Other phrases such as ‘good forest stewardship’ or\n‘well-managed forests’ are often preferred.\nAlthough attempts at comprehensive definitions of SFM will always be argued over, there are\nmany practices that are widely recognized as unsustainable, and which inevitably lead to forest\ndegradation. For example, actions which cause a breakdown in the forest’s ability to regenerate, or\nthat exclude local people’s needs, are unsustainable.\nThe approach taken in this handbook is to define practical sustainable forest management as the\nbest available practices, based on current scientific and traditional knowledge, which allow multiple\nobjectives and needs to be met without degrading the forest resource.\nEarly definitions of sustainable forestry concentrated on the timber resource, with management\naimed at the ‘sustained yield’ of a limited number of wood products. Recently the importance of\nother products and services provided by forests has been recognized, particularly those of broader\nsocial concern. Concepts of SFM now encompass the continued production of these, such as\nprotection of water supply, soils and cultural sites, as well as timber. 1 What is Sustainable Forest\nManagement?
