Due to data collection\nchallenges related to pandemic-related measures, measuring the full impact of COVID-19 is limited for the other Goals.\nThe Progress Chart 2022 clearly demonstrates the deterioration of progress towards many targets, such as poverty, food security, ending the epidemic of malaria, immunization coverage, and\nemployment, caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and conflict. Recent cascading crises have magnified the challenges of achieving the SDGs. Urgent, scaled-up and\ncoordinated actions by all countries are needed to accelerate SDG implementation and avert the devastating impacts in order to get on track and chart a course for better recovery.\nThe progress chart presents two types of information: 1) a trend assessment using stoplight colours to measure progress towards the target (from a baseline year to the most recent data point), and 2)\na level assessment using a gauge meter to measure the current level of development with respect to the distance from a target, using the latest data.

The premature NCD mortality, measured by the unconditional\nprobability of dying from any of the four main NCDs (cardiovascular\ndisease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease) between age 30\nand exact age 70, has declined by 22.2% from 22.9% in 2000 to 17.8% in\n2019.
