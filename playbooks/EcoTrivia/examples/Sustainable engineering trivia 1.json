It implies living well within the ecological limits of a finite planet. It involves the integration of social,\nenvironmental, and economic considerations into the design of product, process, and energy systems. This paper provides a brief\nintroduction to the field of sustainable engineering.\nKey Words: Sustainable Engineering, Green Engineering. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION\nSustainability has been a keyword in the 21th century because it is one of the global grand challenges. For example, we hear\nabout sustainable engineering, sustainable development, sustainable energy, sustainable software, sustainable design, sustainable\nliving, economic sustainability, social sustainability, ecological sustainability, etc. In this same way, there has been considerable\ndiscussion about green chemistry, green engineering, green business, green manufacturing, green food, green economy, green\nenergy, etc. The two terms (sustainability and green) are often used interchangeably. They are related as shown in Figure 2 [1].\nSustainable development has been a major driving initiative in engineering businesses throughout the world. Green engineering\nentails creating healthy living environments that use natural resources wisely and conservatively [2]. Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles for practical purposes such as the design and operation of\nproducts and processes. It expediently utilizes resources to drive the world's economic activity, in virtually all economic sectors,\ne.g., military, industry, transportation, residential, commercial, agriculture, education, telecommunication, etc. Sustainable\nengineering (SE) is the process of designing products and systems such that they use energy and resources sustainably. It\ntransforms existing engineering disciplines, processes, and practices to those that promote sustainability. All engineering\ndisciplines should incorporate sustainability principles into their practice in order to improve the quality of life. CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING\nUnlike traditional engineering approaches, sustainable engineering focuses on projects that are resource efficient, produce\nminimal pollution, and cause little to no damage to the natural environment. Sustainable engineering typically focuses on the\nfollowing areas [3]: food production, water supply, housing and shelter, sanitation and waste management, energy conservation,\ntransportation, industrial processing, environment, pollution prevention, materials management; medical care, and appropriate use\nof technology. The four pillars of sustainability analysis are energy, efficiency, environment, and society. Sustainability analysis is multi\ndisciplinary in nature. It requires approaches from different disciplines such as optimization, social science, and finance.\nSustainability starts with green manufacturing and extends to industrial networks and then to the ecosystem.
